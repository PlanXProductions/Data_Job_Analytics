# Data_Job_Analytics
*Python analysis of competitive data science skills*

# Project Summary
---
 The open source data analyzed was collected and published by Luke Barousse for his Advanced Python Course, and is available at: [Luke Barousse Jobs Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs). 
 
 Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.
